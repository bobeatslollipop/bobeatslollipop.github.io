Peer Mentored the undergraduate algorithm classs in Northwestern university. Graded homeworks and held office hours regarding algorithm-related problems. 
Spring 2022

### Summer Undergraduate Researcher
Participated actively project lead by Adobe and professors from Northwestern University and University of Maryland. Responsible for running and designing experiments for file versioning. In particular, we wish to continue and improve the work https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/2824032.2824035. 
Summer 2022

### Undergraduate Research Fellow
Presented papers and discussed new ideas with other students and professor Konstantin Makarychev. Worked to improve machine learning-augmented data strucutres, such as Bloom filters. In particular, I'm seeking to improve https://iclr.cc/virtual/2021/poster/2672.
