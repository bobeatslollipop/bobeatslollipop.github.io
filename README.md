# About Me
I'm a first-year computer science PhD student at Northwestern University's [theory croup](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/). (We don't have a fixed advisor on our first year!) I am generally interested in theoretical computer science, and my current research focus is on machine learning theory and AMQ-filters. 

Before beginning my PhD studies at Northwestern University, I completed both my undergraduate and master's degrees at the same institution.

# Misc.
I have written two articles on 知乎 (Chinese Quora) about theoretical computer science. Here's a [link](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/643661983) to them. 
I grew up in Beijing, where I lived until I went to college.
