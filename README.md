# About Me
I'm a first-year computer science PhD student at Northwestern University's [theory croup](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/). I am generally interested in theoretical computer science, and my current research focus is on machine learning theory and AMQ-filters. 

Before beginning my PhD studies at Northwestern University, I completed both my undergraduate and master's degrees at the same institution. He

I attended Ross Asia in 2018 as a first year student (and had a great time!), in 2019 as a junior counselor, and in 2020 as a counselor. \\
I took part in the Directed Reading Northwestern's math department. 

**Directed Reading Program**\\
In my sophomore year, I participated in Math department's directed reading program, where I read 6 chapters of Linear Representations of Finite Groups with [Wenyuan Li](https://wenyuanli1995-math.github.io/). I like

# Misc.
I have written two articles on 知乎 (Chinese version of Quora?) about theoretical computer science. Here's a [link](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/643661983) to them. 

I lived for the first 18 years of my life. I am a big fan of Beijing's subway system! (I'm not a big fan of driving, due to the traumatic experience of not finding a parking spot for an hour.)
