# About Me
I'm a first-year computer science PhD student at Northwestern University's [theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/). I am generally interested in theoretical computer science, and my current research focus is on machine learning theory and AMQ-filters. 

Before beginning my PhD studies at Northwestern University, I completed both my undergraduate and master's degrees at the same institution. 

# Research
**To Store or Not to Store: a graph theoretical approach for Dataset Versioning.**\\
with Jingwei Li, Pattara Sukprasert, Samir Khuller, Amol Deshpande, and Koyel Mukherjee. 
_IPDPS 2024_. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11741)

# Education
Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois (2019-2023)\\
B.A. in Math and M.S. in Computer Science

Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois (2023-present)\\
Ph.D. in Computer Science

# Other Experience
**Ross Mathematics Program**\\
I attended Ross Asia in 2018 as a first year student (and had a great time!), in 2019 as a junior counselor, and in 2020 as a counselor. \\

**Directed Reading Program**\\
In 2021 Spring, I participated in Math department's directed reading program, where I read 6 chapters of *Linear Representations of Finite Groups* with [Wenyuan Li](https://wenyuanli1995-math.github.io/). 

# Misc.
I have written two articles on 知乎 (Chinese version of Quora?) about theoretical computer science. Here's a [link](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/643661983) to them. 

I lived in Beijing for the first 18 years of my life. What I like the most about the city is its subway system and shared bicycles, which make travelling very easy and cheap. (I'm not a big fan of driving, due to the traumatic experience of looking for parking spots for an hour.)
