### A brief self-introduction.
I'm a first-year computer science PhD student in Northwestern University's [theory croup](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/). (We don't have a fixed advisor on our first year!) I am generally interested beyond worst-case algorithm analysis and machine learning theory. 

I have written two articles on 知乎 (Chinese Quora) about theoretical computer science. Here's a [link](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/643661983) to them. I also enjoy taking notes of the books I read with Obsidian since 2023 Fall. However, there seems to be a problem with Obsidian Publish, which makes the mathematical equations look strange. 

I grew up in Beijing, where I lived until I went to college.

# Work and Research Experience
### Junior Counselor (2019) and Counselor (2020), Ross Mathematics Program
Lead discussions and daily meetings. Graded problem sets related to number theory, abstract algebra, and real analysis. 

### Peer Mentor, spring 2022
Peer Mentored the undergraduate algorithm classs in Northwestern university. Graded homeworks and held office hours regarding algorithm-related problems. 

### Undergraduate Research, Summer 2022
Participated actively project lead by Adobe and professors from Northwestern University and University of Maryland. Responsible for running and designing experiments for file versioning. In particular, we wish to continue and improve the work https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/2824032.2824035. 

### Undergraduate Research, 2021-2022
Presented papers and discussed new ideas with other students and professor Konstantin Makarychev. Worked to improve machine learning-augmented data strucutres, such as Bloom filters.
