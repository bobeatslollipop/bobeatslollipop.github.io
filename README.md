# About Me

I'm a third-year computer science PhD student at Northwestern University's [theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/). I am generally interested in theoretical computer science. My current research focuses are in learning theory and high-dimensional statistics.  

Before beginning my PhD studies at Northwestern University, I completed both my undergraduate and master's degrees at the same institution. (Go 'Cats!)

<strong>Tight bounds for membership filters with two-sided errors</strong><br>
<em>Manuscript</em>.<br/>
<a href="/assets/main.pdf">See the draft</a>
</summary>

<strong>Summary:</strong> This work establishes tight bounds for membership filters that allow both false positives and false negatives, providing fundamental limits on the trade-offs between space efficiency and error rates. Our bounds generalizes the log 1/FPR classical lower bound, and has an intuitive representation using KL divergence.

<strong>Agnostic Learning of Arbitrary ReLU Activation under Gaussian Marginals</strong><br>
with Aravindan Vijayaraghavan. <em>COLT 2025.</em><br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14349">arXiv version</a> | <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlresearch/v291/main/assets/guo25a/guo25a.pdf">conference version</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/bXVM10VRfcI?si=6dDID4kokQpQcaD2">Recorded virtual talk</a> 
</summary>

<strong>Summary:</strong> We gave the first algorithm for agnostic PAC learning of an arbitrarily biased ReLU neuron under Gaussian input distributions, up to constant approximation. We also showed hardness separation bewteen SQ (statistical query) and CSQ (correlational statistical query) models for this problem. In particular, most gradient-based algorithm would fail to obtain constant approximation.

<summary><strong>To Store or Not to Store: a graph theoretical approach for Dataset Versioning</strong><br>
with Jingwei Li, Pattara Sukprasert, Samir Khuller, Amol Deshpande, and Koyel Mukherjee. 
<em>IPDPS 2024.</em> <br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11741">arXiv version</a> | <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579114">conference version</a>
</summary>

<strong>Summary:</strong> We study a graph-theoretic framework for dataset versioning that optimizes storage costs while maintaining retrieval costs of different versions. On the theory side, we showed the first hardness of approximation results and gave provably near-optimal algorithms for tree-like graphs (bounded treewidth). Our findings also led to better practical heuristics, providing up to 1000x speedup for the "MinSum Retrieval" problem on real-world Github repos.

# Other Experience

**Ross Mathematics Program**\\
I attended Ross Asia in 2018 as a first year student (and had a great time!), in 2019 as a junior counselor, and in 2020 as a counselor. 

**Directed Reading Program**\\
In 2021 Spring, I participated in Math department's directed reading program, where I read 6 chapters of _Linear Representations of Finite Groups_ with [Wenyuan Li](https://wenyuanli1995-math.github.io/). 

**IDEAL Summer Intern**\\
In 2025 Summer, I interned at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC) and studied various topics related to transformers. I was hosted by prof. [Zhiyuan Li](https://zhiyuanli.ttic.edu/).

# Miscellaneous

I have written two articles on 知乎 (Chinese version of Quora?) about theoretical computer science. Here's the [link](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/643661983). 

I lived in Beijing for the first 18 years of my life. What I like the most about the city is its subway system and shared bicycles, which make travelling very easy and cheap. (I'm not a big fan of driving, due to the traumatic experience of looking for parking spots for half an hour.)
