# Work and Research Experience
### Junior Counselor(2019) and Counselor(2020), Ross Mathematics Program
Lead discussions and daily meetings. Graded problem sets related to number theory, abstract algebra, and real analysis. 

### Developer, "dot dev" club, 2020-2021
Worked with teammates to build prototype website "metchup" that matches students into study groups online. Used React for front-end and Google firebase for back-end. 


### Peer Mentor, spring 2022
Peer Mentored the undergraduate algorithm classs in Northwestern university. Graded homeworks and held office hours regarding algorithm-related problems. 


### Undergraduate Research, summer 2022
Participated actively project lead by Adobe and professors from Northwestern University and University of Maryland. Responsible for running and designing experiments for file versioning. In particular, we wish to continue and improve the work https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/2824032.2824035. 

### Undergraduate Research, 2021-2022
Presented papers and discussed new ideas with other students and professor Konstantin Makarychev. Worked to improve machine learning-augmented data strucutres, such as Bloom filters. In particular, I'm seeking to improve https://iclr.cc/virtual/2021/poster/2672. 

### Research Assisstant, 2022
Worked with Dr. Donald Stull on packing dimensions of the projections of 2-dimensional sets onto streight lines. Used Kolmogorov complexity as mathematical tool.
